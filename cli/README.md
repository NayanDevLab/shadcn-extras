# Motion Primitives CLI

A command-line interface for easily adding beautiful, animated components to your React project.

## Installation

You can use the CLI directly with npx:

```bash
npx shadcn-extras <command>
```

Or install it globally:

```bash
npm install -g shadcn-extras
shadcn-extras <command>
```

## Usage

### List available components

To see all available animated components:

```bash
npx shadcn-extras list
```

This will display a list of all available components along with descriptions and required dependencies.

### Add a component

To add a specific component to your project:

```bash
npx shadcn-extras add <component-name>
```

For example:

```bash
npx shadcn-extras add text-morph
```

This will:

1. Create a `components/shadcn-extras` directory in your project (if it doesn't exist)
2. Download and add the component files
3. Automatically install any required dependencies using your preferred package manager (npm, yarn, or pnpm)

The CLI automatically detects which package manager you're using based on lock files in your project.

## Available Components

Motion Primitives offers a variety of beautiful and performant animated components, including:

- **Animated UI Elements**: Accordion, Dialog, Text Effects, Carousels
- **Interactive Animations**: Magnetic elements, Spotlights, Tilt effects
- **Text Animations**: Text morphing, Text loops, Text scramble effects, Spinning text
- **And many more!**

For the complete list, run `npx shadcn-extras list`.

## Dependencies

Most components require the `motion` library. When you add a component, the CLI will automatically install the required dependencies using your preferred package manager.
